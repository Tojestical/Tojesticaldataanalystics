I'm a Data Analyst passionate about turning raw data into powerful, actionable insights that fuel smarter business decisions. With hands-on expertise in SQL, Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and Microsoft Fabric, I specialize in transforming complex data sets into clear visuals and reports that drive growth and efficiency.

My background spans data wrangling, KPI tracking, predictive modeling, and advanced data storytelling—skills I’ve used to uncover trends, diagnose root causes, and support high-impact strategic decisions. I bring a strong foundation in statistical analysis and business intelligence, with experience across both operational reporting and executive dashboards.

While I have experience in financial analysis, my current focus is full-scale data analytics, helping teams optimize performance through informed, data-driven strategies. I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments where data is the backbone of success.

Let’s connect—whether it’s solving problems, building dashboards, or turning numbers into narratives that make a difference.
